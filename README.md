## Description

The project "Historical Trains of Ruegen" is focussed on the history part of the railway.
In the project a website will be created, which helps travellers travelling to Ruegen with trains.
At the history section you will see pictures of steam and old diesel trains.
On the bottom of the picture you will see which train it is, what type of train it is and where you can find it.
You will find other helpful information about trains on Ruegen.
